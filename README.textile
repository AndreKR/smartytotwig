h1. Smarty to Twig

Converts templates in the smarty templating language to the twig templating language.

*Installation*

_python setup.py install_

*Usage:*

_smartytotwig --smarty-file=examples/guestbook.tpl --twig-file=output.twig_



Differences after fork:

- Added smartytotwig.bat
- Renamed "junk" to "whitespace" because usually _junk_ refers to *arbitrary* data that is ignored by a parser
- Assigned some names for the quantifiers 0, -1 and -2
- Can parse config variables (a string like {# ... #} in the Smarty template)
- Allows whitespace within the curly braces of an if condition
